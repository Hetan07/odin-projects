    <h1>There is only you</h1>
    <p>There is only you in this world. One has to do actions
        only for himself, for there is only himself.
    </p>

    <p>The one within you has all the keys that are needed for any
        change
    </p>

    <p>
        There is <em> no one or nothing </em> to change but
        <strong>Yourself</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>You have the capabilities to create your own life</li>
        <li>The inner critic within you is just you</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
        <li><b>There are no two gods, there are no other causes</b></li>
        <li>The one within you creates your own life</li>
